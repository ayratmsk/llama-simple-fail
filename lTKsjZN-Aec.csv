and yet white-winged dauka finches thrive here 5500 m up Also known as glacier birds they come to Kkaya to avoid predators And they've discovered the perfect place to raise a family The glacier itself Two chicks are hidden safely inside The world's only glacier nesting birds And this is the very first time anybody's seen inside one of their nests At night it drops to minus 10 But insulated in their nest it's not the cold that threatens them up here It's the sun The chicks don't have long In less than a month their home will melt out of the ice cliff [Music] It's a race against time In places Kelkaya is receding over 10 m a year Other nests have already fallen [Music] Finally one chick is bold enough to follow its parent into the outside world leaving its sibling all alone Now the nest is beginning to collapse As a last resort the parents cut back on feeding Perhaps a more hungry chick can be coaxed out
